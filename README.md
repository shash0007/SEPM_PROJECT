SEPM Project

This is a simple events project for our SEPM Project.

To immediately get this working:
1. Set up the files in a empty directory. You can create a directory either by using the mkdir command from the terminal or by navigation
   to the location where you may want to setup the directory.
2. Create another directory css/ .
3. Then copy the .css files into the css/ directory.
4. There you go, the sample files are ready.
